## MQTT broker

This game requires input via MQTT Wattage readings. If you already have a MQTT Broker somewhere, configure it correctly: [MQTT broker and topic configuration](#mqtt-topic--broker-config)

### Install Mosquitto (Optional)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y mosquitto mosquitto-clients
```

To run it:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
sudo systemctl start mosquitto
```

Test its working:
```bash
sudo systemctl status mosquitto
mosquitto_pub -t {your/topic} -m 50
```

[mosquitto.org](https://mosquitto.org/)


### MQTT Topic & Broker config

The MQTT Topic and broker connection details are configured in
```bash
#file
powermatch/mqtt_input.py

#Configs:
self.broker = "raspberrypi.local"                               # Change to correct MQTT broker address
self.topic = "/eniwa/energy/device/1091A8AB9138/status/evt"     # Change to correct MQTT topic
```
